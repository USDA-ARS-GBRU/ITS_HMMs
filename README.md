# ITS_HMMs

This repository contains HMMER Hidden Markov Models that are used by the program ITSx and ITSXpress to identify the ends on Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions from eukaryotic genomes.

These models were developed and curated by Henrik Nilsson at the University of Gothenburg.

This repository is an attempt to version the data going forward and record what sets of ITS HMMs were used with each software version

# Version 1

* This is the set of HMM's provided by ITSx 1.1.3 released February 8th, 2021  I do not know how much earlier it was used.
* HMM version 1 was used by ITSxpress from its initial release until version 2.0.2
* HMM N is empty
